											This is the special 2 tier birthday cake that i made this weekend for my daughters 8th birthday party. 
											For these cakes you will probably have to make three or four batches of the doubled recipe so plan ahead on your ingredients. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">

											Whenever i make one of these cakes, my family of 3 (the baby doesn’t eat cake, hah!) usually finish it within 2 days. 
											They’re small enough to be easy and quick to put together, and most of them only require one bowl to make (especially my one bowl chocolate cake). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Spread ¾ cup icing on cake to edges. 
											First developed in the 1930s, cake mixes are the fast and easy solution when it&#039;s time to make a birthday cake.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Basic sponge cake recipe (two tier etc) so when i first started making cakes i always struggled to find recipes for a two tier birthday cake, i think it&#039;s because when using different tin sizes most people just use their normal recipes and adapt it. 
											Pans are sold for 2″ and 3″ deep cakes. 
											But the flavor was changed. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											They should just reach the top of the cake and will help hold up the second tier. 
											The frostings paired with the cupcake recipes listed above are plenty for your 6 inch cake, such as vanilla buttercream or chocolate buttercream.assembling and decorating a 6 inch cake is just like putting together a larger cake, but the smaller size is definitely easier to work with. 
											Cake layers on cake boards. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Prepare two 9 inch round cake pans with cooking spray with flour and parchment paper and set aside.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											My daughter was thrilled when she saw the cake. 
											However if you&#039;re not to great at maths or don&#039;t have the time to practice here is how to do it. 
											It’s a triple layer cake of chocolate goodness that is perfect for sharing. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											If doubling the recipe, add two boxes! 
											Get tiered cake recipe from food network. 
											This chocolate cake is the perfect size. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											No longer are the days of making cake and having leftovers for days. 
											In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. 
											In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the dry ingredients together on low speed for 1 minute. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
