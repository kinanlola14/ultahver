							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>What does my birthday mean in the mayan calendar</strong>. 
					
											The maya zodiac sign calculator can work out to which mayan zodiac sign you belong straight away! 
											The long count calendar keeps track of the days that have passed since the mythical starting date of the maya creation, august 11, 3114 bce. 
											Each of them is cyclical, meaning that a certain number of days must occur before a new cycle can begin. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This signifies magical gift that you have in you. 
											2012 details on december 21, 2012 the mayan long count calendar will be 13.0.0.0.0 (goodman, martinez, thompson calibration). 
											This is placed in the south. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											20 k’in = 1 uinal or 20 days: 
											A reading of the significance of a day and the relevant gods or protectors. 
											They are incredibly strong and, in my experience, often kind, caring, grounded, wise and connected to the natural rhythms of the earth, sun and moon. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Historical events on your birthday; 
											For the past several months, i’ve been getting more interested in the mayan cosmovision—specifically the sacred mayan calendar with its system of 13 tones and 20 totems or day signs. 
											Your birth glyph is placed in the center. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Finding your purpose in life is questioned by many people as they ponder the reasons for their existence. 
											During the wayeb days, ancient mayans felt the natural balance was affected. 
											These ancient peoples had a lot of wisdom about our earth and how we connect to it and through it, so their interpretation of astrology will allow us to venture deeper into the study of ourselves and this universe. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											They left amazing artwork behind along with architecture, which has since been discovered after such a long time since their decline in a.d. 
											Dating way back to the sixth century a.d, the mayans had reached their peak in power and have proved to be extremely skilled at writing, pottery and mathematics, which is why the mayan calendar is so famous. 
											Then the four directions are south, north, east and west. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The reason represents the intelligence that is within all things. 
											What was the number one song on my birthday? 
											The basic unit of time is the day, or k’in. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Before the gregorian calendar that we used today was introduced in 1582, people used different kinds of calendars to keep track of the date, including the mayan and julian calendar. 
											The mayan tzolkin signs are calculated using your birth date, with 260 different combinations what will your sign be?. 
											The mayan calendar is a particularly complex ancient calendar, often confused with the aztec calendar, made up of two separate forms of timekeeping: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											By longer, we mean longer than the haab and the tzolk’in calendars can track. 
											“mayan astrology offers a perspective on human existence not found elsewhere.” ~ how to practice mayan astrology, bruce scofield &amp; barry c. 
											The mayan birth chart is similar to the natal chart generated in western astrology. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This is significant because it indicates a earth orbit event that returns once every 26,000 years (precession of the equinoxes). 
											Find a date in the tonalpohualli, the sacred calendar of the mexica, the aztecs of mexico. 
											Those born in the wayeb sign are the anomaly in the mayan astrology signs. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The meaning of my birthdate defines your purpose in life. 
											Life is the expression of the reason for being. 
											The mayan calendar consists of three separate corresponding calendars: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The exact meanings of the astrology signs are unclear. 
											If you followed step 2 and click on your “galactic dreamspell” name then you go the entire reading which in my humble opinion is quite deep and cosmic. 
											The three calendars are used simultaneously. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											There is a lot of mystery surrounding mayan astrology that persists to this day. 
											The goal is to become one with the galactic mind. 
											Of course, in order to track a period of time with the long count calendar, we will still need the help of the haab and the tzolk’in. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											What day was it on my birthday? 
											Anybody and everybody who are interested to use the mayan calendar symbols can use it for the purpose of finding their path. 
											Many modern interpretations have been offered, however, not many of them are based on research into mayan culture and the symbolism used by them.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											What is known is that the haab calendar used 19 mayan astrology signs to represent the movement of the days. 
											Your mayan birth chart has five different aspects to it. 
											20 katun = 1 baktun or 144,000 days:
