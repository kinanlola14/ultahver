							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>Wishing someone happy birthday in islam</strong>. 
					
											Instead of wishing happy birthday to someone, why don&#039;t you pray for him? 
											When this child grows and does some permanent benefit to the society, its birthday. 
											Embrace this coming year and may allah show you the way to great success. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Every day is a miracle and so are you so i hope you know that i am happy to celebrate today. 
											Happy birthday to you my dear friend. 
											This is the best day to thank allah for sending you into our lives. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Happy birthday to you, love. 
											I admire you for all the things that you are, polite, kind, religious and a whole lot more, dear. 
											Happy birthday to the most romantic husband and the most caring father to my children. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											May allah continue to bless you and yours. 
											You can say a simple happy birthday to them, or say a greeting with a happy birthday word. 
											Sadly, they come once in a year. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We have never heard that sahabah wished happy birthday to the prophet. 
											Declaring anything forbidden (haram) in islam requires explicit evidences from the qur&#039;an or the sunnah or the principles derived from them. 
											I bless allah for keeping you for me. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											You are my one and only hero! 
											Treasure it, respect it and love it. 
											May allah continue to bless you with his divine love beyond this day. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											In the name of allah, most compassionate, most merciful, principally, birthdays are not something that should be celebrated or to be happy about. 
											While other allow to celebrate birthday … 
											This is your day, make the most of it. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											I hope allah shower upon you the choicest blessings of happiness always. 
											More than just being a day of filled with celebration, birthdays are days of blessings. 
											Some muslims say that it is okay to wish someone a happy birthday because those are just words of appreciation. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											However, you should not involve yourself in supporting the celebration in any way because it is against the islamic ruling and cultural practices. 
											By spending on birthday parties, there is no benefit to islam nor to the poor. 
											May god’s blessings be on you forever! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The islamic ruling on acknowledging, celebrating, or wishing someone happy birthday, by imam abu laith luqman ahmad i never been too big on birthday in that i didn’t go all out. 
											I must need to clear few things. 
											May he grant you good health to enjoy all that you&#039;ve worked for. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Wishing many happy returns to the world&#039;s most caring father! 
											May this date be a blessing to us all forever. 
											I am so thankful to mighty allah for blessing me with a friend like you! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Before you check out beautiful islamic birthday greetings. 
											Every day not in his birthday only. 
											Thank you for being such a caring and loving dad to me. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Today is a reminder of how much you’re worth to me and the family. 
											I pray allah give you enough strength and resources for the tasks ahead. 
											What is the ruling with regard to wishing someone happy birthday in islam? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Birthdays are meant to forget the past and welcome the future with a new zeal. 
											Happy birthday to you, with endless wishes from me. 
											Let us see samples of islamic birthday messages for sister: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Dear sister i wish you a happy birthday celebration. 
											More than being a day of fun, a birthday is a day of showing to the world your most beautiful smile. 
											Say your wish directly while you say a happy birthday can be one of the ways to make them happier. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Wishing you a romantic happy birthday! 
											There’s no husband in the world more perfect and more romantic than mine. 
											Wishing you a very happy birthday with a hope that this would be the best birthday ever. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Islamic people also celebrate birthday in a grand way and send birthday greetings on their special day. 
											Birthday is to be celebrated by society the birthday celebration of your child should be later on and should be done by others and not by the parents and relatives. 
											This is just like telling someone, you are smartly dressed. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Wishing or celebrating birthday in islam is quite sensitive topic, some ulma &amp; muftis say its prohibited in islam. 
											The day of someone&#039;s birthday must be a normal day and there shouldn&#039;t be any birthday parties. 
											Birthday wishes for husband in islam. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Islamic religious happy birthday wishes, sms, quotes and sayings: 
											Wishing you a very happy birthday. 
											More than being a day of gifts, it is a day of love and giving love back. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Gift for someone who has a birthday is not mandatory but giving gifts in islam is permissible. 
											Only the lucky people in this world are able to meet their soulmates. 
											And if something cannot be proved to be haram in the aforementioned way then that has to be considered halal by the default rule [qur&#039;an 2:29]. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It is very simple to do but can make people happy. 
											These wishes will surely make them feel happy from within as these wishes are not just the common ones but these have allah’s name in it which itself makes the messages and quotes divine and full of blessings! 
											If you ever need someone to talk to i am just right here, so happy birthday muslim friend! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											You are a trinket of blessing from allah and i thank him for you. 
											Wa alaikum as salaam, when looked at it from the angle of its meaning, the words ‘happy birthday’ simply tells a person that you are happy for his birthday and you are wishing him joy and happiness on that day. 
											May allah bless you today and every day! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This is a baseless unislamic practice. 
											I wish you all the best of this day and i pray allah grant your wishes, too. 
											Every year i wish you happy birthday and you just keeps on getting better and lovelier. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Another object of the birthday parties is showoff. 
											What is the islaamic view on wishing someone a happy birthday. 
											Birthday is a special day to thank allah for the beautiful gift which he has given to us… a gift of life! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Why would wishing someone on their birthday be a sin? 
											When it is someone&#039;s birthday, one year of his/her life has decreased, and not increased. 
											For any adults, this may work perfectly but for children, sometimes it can be hard tough. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											However, being away from most of my family, and getting birthday wishes from my children, grandchildren and my beloved sister especially, and going out to differ with.
