		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>Bible says also this about jesus christ as the eternal word of god in john 1 “in the beginning was the word (jesus), and the word was with god, and the word was god.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>When is jesus christ birthday in the bible</strong>. 
					
											God did not give christmas to us as jesus birthday it was man made only doing it himself. 
											Jesus&#039; birth, death and resurrection. 
											More to the point, if jesus&#039; birthday is celebrated on august 21 of the current calendar, is that really the anniversary of his birth? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But the bible clearly reveals he was not born… 
											Since herod played a major role in the narrative of jesus’ birth (see matthew 2), jesus would have had to be born before herod died. 
											And he’s right about that. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time. 
											2 in those days caesar augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire roman world. 
											The most detailed account of christ’s birth is found in luke 2. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus christ’s birthday is unknown. 
											The bible teaches that men are in revolt and rebellion against god but that god has acted to establish peace through his son jesus christ, the mediator. 
											Not only is any hint of a celebration of christ’s birth absent from the new testament, but the bible is also strikingly silent when it comes to the actual date of his birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											While this is sometimes debated, the majority of new testament scholars place jesus’ birth in 4 b.c. 
											Preface the following is part of a short series of devotional items related to the birth of christ. 
											He is the central figure of christianity, the world&#039;s largest religion.most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah (the christ) prophesied in the old testament. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Tradition has made december 25th the birthday of jesus. 
											In which year was jesus born?. 
											We have shared popular bible verses about christmas as well as the full scripture story of christ&#039;s birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth, based on the conception and birth of john the baptist. 
											Regardless, the c oworker doesn’t believe december 25 is jesus’ birthday. 
											It says, for there is one god, and one mediator between god and men, the man, christ jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men — the testimony given in its proper time ( 1 timothy 2:5. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Use these verses to share the story of hope and love through the birth of god&#039;s son, jesus christ. 
											Although millions of people celebrate the birth of jesus christ on dec. 
											The bible does not tell us when jesus was born. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus was called immanuel (which means god with us), as foretold by the prophet isaiah. 
											And he’s right about that. 
											(luke 2:13, 14) however, it is noteworthy that nowhere in the bible is there even a suggestion that jesus’ birthday should be celebrated. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Consider the weather conditions at that time of the year in bethlehem, where jesus was born. 
											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day 
											This is because most date the death of king herod the great to 4 b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It not on december 25. 
											That is one way to honor jesus. 
											For some, such material is hardly devotional because it primarily focuses on history. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											25, most scholars agree that he wasn&#039;t born on that day, or even in the year 1 a.d. 
											History convincingly shows that december 25 was popularized as the date for christmas, not because christ was born on that day but because it was already popular in pagan religious celebrations as the birthday of the sun. 
											2 (this was the first census that took place while [] quirinius was governor of syria.() 3 and everyone went to their own town to register4 so joseph also went up from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea, to bethlehem the town of david, because he belonged to the. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Christian roman emperor constantine first established. 
											The jewish month of chislev (corresponding to november/ december) was a month with cold and rainy weather. 
											The birth of jesus christ is the one of the most significant events in all of history and when we understand the truths regarding the true date of his birth it will thrill and inspire your heart. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
											In contrast, there is a specific command to commemorate his death, which jehovah’s witnesses do once a year. 
											The earliest documented date of christmas being observed on december 25th was in 336, during the era of the roman emperor constantine (the first christian roman emperor). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											If jesus christ wasn&#039;t born on december 25, does the bible indicate when he was born? 
											However, it does give us sound reason to conclude that his birth did not take place in december. 
											God in the flesh came to live with mankind. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											In another occasion jesus said to the disciples, “jesus said to them, “truly, truly, i say to you, before abraham was, i am.” john 8:48. 
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											But it was not a formal roman state holiday at that time. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
											Despite not knowing the exact birthday of jesus, we celebrate his birth on december 25th as has been christian tradition for centuries. 
											The bible does not specify a date or a month when jesus was born. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The bible don’t give us jesus birthday. 
											When the julian calendar was established, julius caesar set march 25 as the date of the vernal equinox, which was also taken by many people as the beginning of a new year.
