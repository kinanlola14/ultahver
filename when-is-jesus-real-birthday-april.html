	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p>Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born.the. 7 years ago (2001), the bbc and discovery channel reported that april 17, 6 bc was jesus&#039; actual birthday. Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar. <br>

		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>The birth of jesus christ is the one of the most significant events in all of history and when we understand the truths regarding the true date of his birth it will thrill and inspire your heart.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>When is jesus real birthday april</strong>. 
					
											Then, by the modern scientific technology, we know that april 17 (sat.), 6 b.c. 
											One based on the accounts in the gospels of his birth. 
											Talmage maintained that jesus christ was born on april 6 in the year 1 bc. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Although it’s not impossible, it seems unlikely that jesus was really born on december 25. 
											Needless to say, if herod was dead in 4 b.c., a 1 b.c. 
											He based his conclusion on the understanding that the savior was born in the spring and in doctrine and covenants 20:1 , which speaks of the church being organized “one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Regardless, the c oworker doesn’t believe december 25 is jesus’ birthday. 
											Jesus was born on april 6 unknown. 
											This date mostly comes from james e. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Here are three reasons why jesus may not have been born on december 25 at all. 
											M ost biblical scholars and preachers readily admit that they know christ was not born on december 25th. 
											Let&#039;s celebrate both easter and true birthday of jesus christ (april 17)! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It was estimated to be september 6, september 11, or september 29. 
											Talmage’s book, “jesus the christ” and from an interpretation from doctrine and covenants 20:1. 
											Some scholars think that he was born between 6 b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Talmage was apparently the first lds writer to propose this particular date. 
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
											Tradition has made december 25th the birthday of jesus. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But as many gather to exchange gifts, sing carols and marvel at nativity scenes and christmas trees, the story behind jesus. 
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time. 
											Jesus born on april 17, 6 bc (17/4/747 auc) &amp; crucified fri. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This value supports his birth date of april 6, 1 bc and his death date of april 1, 33 ad, with the resurrection date on april 3, 33 ad. 
											Well, the easter is the day to celebrate the resurrection of jesus christ, who was made to the crucifixion by the cross and was killed. 
											And 4 b.c., based partly on the biblical story of herod the great. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When jesus was born seems to have an obvious answer since our dating system is based on the idea that jesus was born between the eras we call b.c. 
											When the julian calendar was established, julius caesar set march 25 as the date of the vernal equinox, which was also taken by many people as the beginning of a new year. 
											Assuming jesus was an historical figure, the star. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											No one knows the exact date but it is somewhere in the fall. 
											Christians around the world celebrate dec. 
											But the bible clearly reveals he was not born on that day. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											April 7, 30 ad (7/4/782) discussion in &#039; christian history &#039; started by brad watson miami 1, jul 17, 2011. 
											Chadwick&#039;s article in byu studies goes on for pages, using fixed dates to extrapolate other dates. 
											In his 1915 classic jesus the christ, elder james e. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And he’s right about that. 
											More to the point, if jesus&#039; birthday is celebrated on august 21 of the current calendar, is that really the anniversary of his birth? 
											This date had already been reported by cnn and history channel for the last 4 years. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											However, the date of jesus&#039; birth is not explicitly stated in the gospels. 
											Was the true birthday when jesus christ was really born. 
											But is it possible that december 25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And he’s right about that. 
											Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of jesus: 
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.the date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											25 as the birth of jesus. 
											However, they claim that this day is as good as any other to celebrate the birth of jesus, despite the fact that it was originally a pagan celebration called saturnalia which commemorated the birth of the sun god. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth, based on the conception and birth of john the baptist. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											You can tell approximately when it is if you read a bible. 
											So if jesus had to be born before april 4 b.c., can the time be narrowed further? 
											Christians also celebrate the birth of jesus near the winter solstice, on christmas, or the epiphany (january 6). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Talmage suggested the possibility in jesus the christ that the savior was born on april 6, 1 b.c. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
											Jesus&#039; real birthday is not on april 17th or anywhere near it. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But nobody really knows exactly when jesus was born. 
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
											Christian roman emperor constantine first established. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Birthday of christ is impossible. 
									</p>
