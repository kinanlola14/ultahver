					<p>This god of light was believed to have been born from the earth, paralleling jesus&#039; birth as true man. Although it is difficult to determine the first time anyone celebrated december 25 as christmas day, historians are in general agreement that it was sometime during the fourth century. Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar. <br>

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>What day is jesus christ birthday</strong>. 
					
											The earliest documented date of christmas being observed on december 25th was in 336, during the era of the roman emperor constantine (the first christian roman emperor). 
											Jesus was born on the 1st day of the feast of tabernacles! 
											The encyclopædia britannica says that church leaders probably chose it “to coincide with the pagan roman festival marking the ‘birthday of the unconquered sun,’” at the time of the winter solstice. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											American king james version ×. 
											Regardless, the c oworker doesn’t believe december 25 is jesus’ birthday. 
											It is christmas and christians from across the world have joined to celebrate this pompous festival which marks the birth of jesus christ. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Christians honor jesus on christmas day with a wide variety of customs; 
											M ost biblical scholars and preachers readily admit that they know christ was not born on december 25th. 
											Remember jesus christ on his birthday by sending these jesus birthday cards and spread the message of love and honesty. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											25, most scholars agree that he wasn&#039;t born on that day, or even in the year 1 a.d. 
											If you take a close look at scripture, it indicates that this is an unlikely date for. 
											“since john was born on passover, the 15th day of nisan (the 1st jewish month), jesus would have been born six months later on the 15th day of tishri (the 7th jewish month). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.the date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
											But is it possible that december 25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Since there is no evidence that the birth of jesus christ occurred on december 25, why is christmas celebrated on this date? 
											The day celebrated as christmas (december 25) is the actual birthday of jesus. 
											Happy birthday jesus, thank you, father, and merry christmas to all! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Religious music is a major feature of the christmas season, from simple caroling to glorious performances of handel&#039;s messiah oratorio. 
											This is an amazingly late date. 
											And he’s right about that. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Despite not knowing the exact birthday of jesus, we celebrate his birth on december 25th as has been christian tradition for centuries. 
											However, they claim that this day is as good as any other to celebrate the birth of jesus, despite the fact that it was originally a pagan celebration called saturnalia which commemorated the birth of the sun god. 
											May the father be magnified and praised from sea to sea and in every land in jesus mighty name! 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Spread the message of peace. 
											Joy to the world, the lord is come. 
											While december 25 was popularized as the date for christmas, it was not because jesus was born on that day. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											Jesus’ birthday 2020 is celebrated every year on 25th december. 
											The first official mention of december 25 as a holiday honoring jesus’ birthday appears in an early roman calendar from 336 a.d. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											He is the central figure of christianity, the world&#039;s largest religion.most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah (the christ) prophesied in the old testament. 
											For many, christmas brings about lavishly decorated storefronts, religious services, celebrations with family and friends, and, of course, presents galore.people pray, sing, dance, and exchange gifts on the days leading up to christmas in order to celebrate the birth of jesus christ—and yet, what most people don&#039;t even realize is that december 25 isn&#039;t actually jesus&#039;s birthday. 
											But was jesus really born on december 25 in the first place. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											That sacrifice began the day of the birth of christ and finished after the cross of calvary. 
											Most include reenactments of the nativity scene depicting jesus&#039; humble birth. 
											The church even announced at one point that it was sinful to contemplate observing christ’s birthday “as.

											Christmas comes from the “mass of christ.” it was the only service allowed to take place after sunset and before sunrise the next day, which is why we have midnight mass. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But it was not a formal roman state holiday at that time. 
											Although millions of people celebrate the birth of jesus christ on dec. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Christian roman emperor constantine first established december 25 as christmas day in 336. 
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time. 
											Christianity is the biggest religion in the world. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But among the upper classes, the holiest day of the year was december 25, the birthday of mithras, the sun god. 
											The birth of jesus christ is traditionally celebrated on december 25 th, although “around 37 percent of orthodox christians, mainly in egypt and russia, celebrate christmas on january 7,” owing to a difference in the way their calendars were devised. 
											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born
