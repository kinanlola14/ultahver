		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>Also, it has not been confirmed that september 29 was the actual birthdate.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>When is jesus birthday in september</strong>. 
					
											How about we make everyday a day to say happy birthday to jesus and thank you? 
											At the time of the birth of jesus, when that big new star was shining in the night sky, shepherds were out in the fields, watching their flocks by night. 
											Several facts point to the actual birth of jesus taking place in september or october. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											[38] alexander murray of history today argues that the celebration of christmas as the birth day of jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis. 
											The time of year that jesus was born is a matter of some debate, but the exact timing of jesus’ birth is nothing to be dogmatic about, given the bible’s lack of detail on the subject. 
											Add another nine months for mary’s pregnancy, and the timeline falls to approximately late september or early october for jesus’ birthday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Knowing that october 1 is a tuesday, the trip to nazareth most likely began on sunday. 
											If jesus&#039; real birthday could&#039;ve been in august or september then why does everyone i know say his birthday is on december 25? 
											Jesus&#039; birthday is on the same day in the two calendars. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar. 
											The bible says that when jesus was born, a multitude of angels appeared suddenly and erupted in joyful praise to god, saying: 
											Thursday, september 29, and monday, december 5 (122:8.7). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Was jesus actually born in september? answer: 
											How do know when he was born? 
											Others know by careful study of the great pyramid at giza. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Tradition would have us believe that there were three wise men, and that they came to the manger. 
											Late december would be the time when the holy spirit overshadowed mary and she conceived. 
											There are many different theories as to why christmas is celebrated on december 25. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The next date is tuesday, october 1, 4 b.c. 
											Jesus’ approximate age at the start of his ministry (30) is also supplied in the book of luke, so we can determine that christ was likely born around 2 or 3bc. 
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Birthdays celebrate beginnings, and the celebration of christmas is both a birthday and a beginning in more ways than one. 
											Some know by a careful historic study, like chuck missler did. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The bible does not specify a date or a month when jesus was born. 
											Dec 12, 2020 ewq1938 when something is mind bottling staff member supervisor supporter 
											Happy to hear too what you think on predicting the rapture according to the (incorrect) understanding of the sept 23 2017 astral sign in bethulah (virgo) and arieh (leo). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus&#039; birth, death and resurrection. 
											God reveals jesus&#039; birthday to john the apostle john the apostle reports that on august 19, 2017, god revealed to him in a dream that jesus was born on september 19 in the year 3 bc. 
											Tradition teaches that jesus was born on december 25, when it is very cold, and sometimes snowy, in bethlehem. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Assuming that jesus was born at the feast of tabernacles (late september), there is still a very good reason to celebrate on december 25th, which would be nine months prior to a late september birth. 
											On september 11, 3 b.c., sunset was at 6:18pm and moonset at 7:39pm. 
											Jesus’ birth during that time is impossible for several reasons. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We believe the evidence supports the conclusion that jesus was born in september. 
											(123:0.6), when joseph had finally convinced everyone that it was time to return to nazareth. 
											“glory in the heights above to god, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.” (luke 2:13, 14) however, it is noteworthy that nowhere in the bible is there even a suggestion that jesus’ birthday should be. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The configuration of the sun and the moon was visible in palestine between sunset and moonset, this twilight period being called “night” in the bible. 
											There was a day when jesus was born, sometime over 2000 years ago. 
											When properly examined, it is obvious that jesus could not have been born during any one of the three pilgrim feasts: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											So, when was jesus born? 
											But is it possible that december 25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											September 11, 2013 at 10:57 am public for many today, september 11, is a terrible day full of bad memories and the loss of loved ones. 
											The day and month of christ’s birth are even more difficult to establish. 
											First, jesus was born in a stable (luke 2:7) but the “wise men” visited jesus in a house (matthew 2:11). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											No one knows the real birthday of jesus. 
											But one thing is for sure. 
											When awassi rams and ewes are raised together, lambing occurs in nearly 85 percent of the ewes between mid september and mid march, but mostly in january. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Interestingly, while jesus is associated primarily with christianity in the western world, other religions also recognize him as a significant figure. 
											Jesus&#039; birthday who was jesus christ, and why is december 25 a major holiday celebrated across all geographic, political, and religious boundaries? 
											It is not on december 25. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											He is the central figure of christianity, the world&#039;s largest religion.most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah (the christ) prophesied in the old testament.
