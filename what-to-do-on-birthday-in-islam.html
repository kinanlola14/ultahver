							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>What to do on birthday in islam</strong>. 
					
											Misunderstanding over this issue evokes strong emotions and often leads to bitter arguments among the common muslims. 
											Feed homeless people some cake, ask them to make some duas for you. 
											This is accompanied by singing happy birthday happy birthday to that person then it is concluded by blowing the candles in one breath. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The prophet never celebrated them. 
											After that, you then eat from that a cake. 
											Therefore, there wasn&#039;t ever need to celebrate them, because if it were ok to do so, we would know about it. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This birthday, i pray to allah to give you whatever your heart desires for. 
											Islam is one of the major religions in the world and if you plan to celebrate an islamic birthday, you need to be aware of their traditions, their fasting season; 
											If birthday celebration was considered as bid’ah because it was never done by the prophet muhammad and because of hadith, ‘someone who imitates a people, he seems to be a part of that people”. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But that said the majority of muslims; 
											However, the better thing to do is to make a dua (supplication) and to ask allah to bless the person on his birthday. 
											I remember how you taught me to be strong and courageous. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Visit poor families and celebrate your birthday with them. 
											Amongst those teachings is a strong stand on following the ways, and approved actions of the prophet muhammad. 
											So, if you want to celebrate your birthday based on islam ways, you can do thanksgiving with orphans, recitations, alms and many more. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The most important thing in celebrating a birthday is to say a birthday prayer. 
											The belief behind this practice is far from islam, if you practiced it due to ignorance, then you&#039;re not at fault, but when you have knowledge and continue to practice pagan rituals, then you&#039;re at fault and will be brought to account in the judgement day. 
											My dear father on your birthday, i want to thank you. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When it is someone&#039;s birthday, one year of his/her life has decreased, and not increased. 
											Although, muslims can live the way they want different from the. 
											Islam is a peaceful religion. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And if something cannot be proved to be haram in the aforementioned way then that has to be considered halal by the default rule [qur&#039;an 2:29]. 
											“follow what has been sent down unto you from your lord, and follow not any awliyaa’ (protectors, helpers, etc.) besides him. 
											Praying for the forgiveness of allah and being grateful for the favors that have been given are the best way to celebrate your birthday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When she told me she was going to get me a gift, i told her that i did not need and want anything, but she still ended up giving me a gift anyway. 
											If you are a person of faith in islam, you must reach your loved ones with islamic birthday wishes on their special days! 
											You see that the cake has candles which match the number of your age is foreign. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This is what is evident from the teachings of islam when there are happy occasions. 
											“whoever does something that is a not part of this matter of ours (i.e., islam) will have it rejected 
											Celebrating an institutions birthday bismillah i do understand that celebrating ones birthday is haram so what about celebrating an institutions birthday the date when the institution was established by holding socialcharitable acts for example a school was established on 11 march 1970 and on march 2020 not exactly on 11 march 2020 the school plan to hold a series of good events such as. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											May allah show you miracles every day and may you be the luckiest soul on earth. 
											The issue of cutting a birthday cake in islam is haram and should never be practiced at all. 
											Here is presented the islamic way to celebrate the birthday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											A birthday wish does not contain mere greetings only, but also surmises heartfelt wishes, prayers, and words of blessings! 
											Birthdays are undoubtedly a special occasion for people of all ages. 
											Tagged birthday celebration in islam zakir naik, birthday celebrations in islam, birthday in islam hadith, birthday in islam halal or haram, birthday in islam halal or haram in urdu, celebrating birthdays in islam, celebrating birthdays in islam mufti menk, did sahaba celebrate mawlid, eid milaad un nabi, eid milad un nabi in saudi arabia. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											In 2011, muslim leader darul uloom deoband advised muslims against the celebration of birthdays, stating that islam did not allow such celebrations of western. 
											Nevertheless you can just tell your friends and greet them an islamic birthday or just tell them that you wish to tell greet them in an islamic birthday kind of way. 
											Blow the candles and make a wish, allah is always listening. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Declaring anything forbidden (haram) in islam requires explicit evidences from the qur&#039;an or the sunnah or the principles derived from them. 
											Birthday celebrations are disliked in islam for several reasons. 
											This is what i pray for you on this special day of yours. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											On your birthday, dear father, we want to wish you success in business, love and health. 
											You have to ensure a lot of things. 
											Why would wishing someone on their birthday be a sin? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Do list down sins you mostly committed in last year ask forgiveness from allah and make sure not to commit them in future. 
											In the name of allah, most compassionate, most merciful, principally, birthdays are not something that should be celebrated or to be happy about. 
											Clearly, the birthday culture is derived from pagan religion and has no place in islam. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Do never forget to thank allah for everything you have and you do not have. 
											In the name of allah, we praise him, seek his help and ask for his forgiveness. 
											Say and give a birthday prayer. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Muslims try as much to stay strictly on the path of islamic teachings. 
											There is no specific text or teaching in islam that says that one must or must not celebrate birthdays.
