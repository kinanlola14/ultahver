											Jesus’ parents came to bethlehem to register in a roman census. 
											There is another way to approach the truth. 
											Astronomers have calculated that christmas should be in june, by charting the appearance of the &#039;christmas star&#039; which the bible says led the three. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus was born in a.d. 
											It makes one wonder if jesus died on his birthday. 
											(luke 2:13, 14) however, it is noteworthy that nowhere in the bible is there even a suggestion that jesus’ birthday should be celebrated.

											On sunday, august 21, 7 b.c. 
											Tradition has made december 25th the birthday of jesus. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus was born at 12:00 p.m. 
											God had once again come to tabernacle with his people. 
											The complete book of american holidays, luke&#039;s account suggests that jesus may have been born in summer or early fall.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The census or enrollment which according to luke 2:1 was the occasion of the journey of joseph and mary to bethlehem where jesus. 
											The word christmas was never written in the bible.never the world claim they are celebrating jesus birthday, if that is so, well go to church and celebrate it. 
											What the bible says about the birth of jesus obviously, the new testament is the best starting place for piecing together the most important facts about jesus’ birth.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Was jesus actually born in september? answer: 
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e.

											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born.the. 
											The birth of jesus christ is traditionally celebrated on december 25 th, although “around 37 percent of orthodox christians, mainly in egypt and russia, celebrate christmas on january 7,” owing to a difference in the way their calendars were devised.

											In contrast, there is a specific command to commemorate his death, which jehovah’s witnesses do once a year. 
											Another benefit of ascertaining the actual leap years of the early julian calendar is the ability to assign weekdays to the b.c. 
											When we consider these factors, it seems plausible that jesus’ birthday was possible during the feast of tabernacles in 6 b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The complete book of american holidays, luke&#039;s account suggests that jesus may have been born in summer or early fall. 
											And how it is that the jewish year remains so far behind the actual years since adm and eve. 
											&#039;jesus was born in june&#039;, astronomers claim.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But nobody really knows exactly when jesus was born. 
											If the deciples didn&#039;t celebrate jesus birthday, why are we celebrating it. 
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											7 years ago (2001), the bbc and discovery channel reported that april 17, 6 bc was jesus&#039; actual birthday. 
											According to the bible jeremiah 52:31jehoiachin released. 
											Therefore this is a made up pagan holiday and they wraped it up and called it christmas to. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And behold, an angel of the lord stood before them, and the glory of the lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.” 
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25. 
											By 731 and after, it was clear that there had existed a year we could call a.d.
