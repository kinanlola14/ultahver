											Finding your purpose in life is questioned by many people as they ponder the reasons for their existence. 
											Historical events on your birthday; 
											In his epistle to the romans, paul addresses the issue of which day should be the day of worship, but perhaps we could also apply this to christian birthday.

									</p>

											That is indeed the case. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Christians believe that the bible is inspired by god, is without error, and does not misrepresent the facts. 
											Your core purpose indicated by your birthdate consists of qualities to be developed through your thinking, the ideals to be accomplished, and success to be made. 
											Read god’s word at anytime, anywhere using the youversion bible app. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">

											Nowhere does the bible tell us not to be happy and rejoice over certain things, including the day of our birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Using john&#039;s death on the day herod decided to throw a party to celebrate when he was born, as a reason to shun rejoicing over one&#039;s birth, is a fallacious guilt by association argument. 
											It is entirely trustworthy and is the final authority on everything it teaches. 
											These are some of our favorite bible quotes to let someone know how very special they are to you and to god. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Your birthdate defines your core purpose in life.
