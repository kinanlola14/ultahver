		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>(123:0.6), when joseph had finally convinced everyone that it was time to return to nazareth.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>When is jesus real birthday september</strong>. 
					
											How about we make everyday a day to say happy birthday to jesus and thank you? 
											Additionally, the timing of the birth of john the baptist lends further support that jesus was born in september. 
											But is it possible that december 25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.the date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
											Although it’s not impossible, it seems unlikely that jesus was really born on december 25. 
											Let us look at the facts. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Many readers will know that i believe the actual birthdate of jesus was sept 11, 3 bc. 
											Dec 12, 2020 ewq1938 when something is mind bottling staff member supervisor supporter 
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											When properly examined, it is obvious that jesus could not have been born during any one of the three pilgrim feasts: 
											Science and the bible align perfectly if you rightly divide the word and understand it with that power of the holy spirit leading. 
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											7/4=july 4 and 17/4/747 auc is jesus&#039; birthday, 4/17/6 bc and july 4, 1776. 
											The bible says that when jesus was born, a multitude of angels appeared suddenly and erupted in joyful praise to god, saying: 
											Amazingly this corresponds to tishri 1 on the jewish calendar which is the first day of the festival of the feast of trumpets. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We also don’t celebrate easter in our home. 
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time. 
											Amazingly this corresponds to tishri 1 on the jewish calendar which is the first day of the festival of the feast of trumpets. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Was jesus actually born in september? answer: 
											M ost biblical scholars and preachers readily admit that they know christ was not born on december 25th. 
											It is not on december 25. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											There are real answers to ask questions in the word of god. 
											However, they claim that this day is as good as any other to celebrate the birth of jesus, despite the fact that it was originally a pagan celebration called saturnalia which commemorated the birth of the sun god. 
											Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											On september 11, 3 b.c., sunset was at 6:18pm and moonset at 7:39pm. 
											Also, it has not been confirmed that september 29 was the actual birthdate. 
											But one thing is for sure. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											December 25th was the day of conception. 
											The next date is tuesday, october 1, 4 b.c. 
											Jesus&#039; birthday is on the same day in the two calendars. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											No one knows the real birthday of jesus. 
											Jesus’ birth during that time is impossible for several reasons. 
											The birth of jesus christ is traditionally celebrated on december 25 th, although “around 37 percent of orthodox christians, mainly in egypt and russia, celebrate christmas on january 7,” owing to a difference in the way their calendars were devised.(egypt today.)neither date is likely correct in light of several clues uncovered by historians and information in the bible itself. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Or 29 september in our calendar. 
											The time of year that jesus was born is a matter of some debate, but the exact timing of jesus’ birth is nothing to be dogmatic about, given the bible’s lack of detail on the subject. 
											Martin’s the star that astonished the world (which can be read for free). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This date was remembered as a christian church feast, st. 
											Luke says that jesus began preaching when he reached 30. 
											Christianity is a reality not a religion. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											“glory in the heights above to god, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.” (luke 2:13, 14) however, it is noteworthy that nowhere in the bible is there even a suggestion that jesus’ birthday should be. 
											In september, the sheep would have been in the fields overnight, travel in judea would have been possible, and, significantly, god came to dwell with his people. 
											Here are three reasons why jesus may not have been born on december 25 at all. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											G is the 7th letter, a circle that is either the 15th letter or zero, and d the 4th letter. 
											Knowing that october 1 is a tuesday, the trip to nazareth most likely began on sunday. 
											At the time of the birth of jesus, when that big new star was shining in the night sky, shepherds were out in the fields, watching their flocks by night. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											I’ve also heard the date of september 29th as the birthday of christ. 
											This isn’t based on any original research of my own (here’s a short youtube video of me discussing the date).rather, it is based on the work of e. 
											At this point, you’re probably wondering what jesus’ birthday has to do with the feast of tabernacles. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Some bible experts say that jesus might have been born by the end of september, based on the conception and birth of john the baptist. 
											Thursday, september 29, and monday, december 5 (122:8.7). 
											Several facts point to the actual birth of jesus taking place in september or october. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Most academics are unaware of martin’s research because he wasn’t a member. 
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											John the baptist’s birth provides insight. 
											If jesus&#039; real birthday could&#039;ve been in august or september then why does everyone i know say his birthday is on december 25? 
									</p>
