						<h1>Why Do Jehovah Witnesses Not Celebrate Birthdays</h1>

	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p>Jehovah&#039;s witnesses are not against parties, music, dancing and drinking of alcohol, as long as they are done in moderation. However, what it is they do instead is, celebrate the feast day of the saint whom they are named after. Jehovah&#039;s witnesses do not celebrate birthdays because we refuse to give an act of worship to (artemis) the pagan goddess of birthdays. <br>

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>Why do jehovah witnesses not celebrate birthdays</strong>. 
					
											We instead choose to remain loyal to jehovah god, and to him alone. 
											As many people know, jehovah’s witnesses don’t celebrate christmas, new year’s, easter, halloween, valentine’s day, or any national holiday (independence day, thanksgiving), and they don’t celebrate birthdays. 
											Holidays that are based on the idea that the soul is immortal. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jehovah&#039;s witnesses in general are nice i was one and my family all are. 
											Why do jehovah&#039;s witnesses not celebrate birthdays? a. 
											The bible clearly states that the soul can die. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Many of jehovah’s witnesses observe wedding anniversaries. 
											Weddings, anniversaries, and funerals are observed, however holidays such as new year&#039;s day, easter, halloween, and christmas are not celebrated, as jehovah&#039;s witnesses believe these customs come from ancient false religions. 
											Whilst the majority of witnesses do not celebrate birthdays because it is forbidden, if tomorrow the watchtower decided to state birthdays are acceptable, few would object on scriptural grounds. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											This is because there are no pagan origins connected to marriage or wedding rings. 
											The other reason they won&#039;t associate with you is because your not a jw. 
											They celebrate it once per year, noting that it was instituted on the passover, an annual festival. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											It is significant that the only two direct references in the bible to birthday celebrations (pharaoh of egypt and herod antipas) were remembered for executions and painted in a negative light. 
											It wasn&#039;t a jewish custom at the time to celebrate birthdays, job was asian not jewish hence why he celebrated them. 
											But here is why jehovah&#039;s witnesses do not participate in birthday observances: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Although the bible does not explicitly forbid celebrating birthdays, it does help us to reason on key features of these events and understand god’s view of them. 
											This is telling as to how solid the scriptural grounds for such a doctrine is. 
											Jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate birthdays because we believe that such celebrations displease god. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We believe that salvation comes only through jesus christ.” 
											They believe the new year’s holiday is rooted in the pagan celebration of janus, the roman god of beginning and transitions. 
											To provide a basis in understanding why jehovah&#039;s witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, it is important to consider that jehovah&#039;s witnesses place the highest priority on basing their beliefs, their standards for conduct, and organizational procedures on the bible.so then, there needs to be an honest examination to bible references and principles regarding birthdays. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Questions from readers section in the watchtower magazine dated october 15, 1998, page 30 poses this question: 
											I was going to ask why they don&#039;t celebrate christmas too but i found this on wikipedia: 
											Well if you hate jehovah&#039;s witnesses then move to russia because they put a religious ban on jehovah&#039;s witnesses and they call it a extremist group. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The site noted that a common misconception (myth) among people is that jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate christmas because “they do not believe in jesus.” but, quoting from the bible book of acts 4:12, it says the fact is that “we are christians. 
											Marriage was divinely instituted by the one true god.jehovah. 
											While not celebrating these occasions is not directly spoken in the bible, there are reasons jehovah&#039;s witnesses believe these celebrations are against god&#039;s will. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											While of christians all over the world celebrate the christmas as the time that jesus christ was born, the jehovah’s witnesses frown at such celebration which the tag as a pagan celebration. 
											This question is understandable, both things seem very similar, so let me explain. 
											If you were to tell a jehovah’s witness that he or she is in a cult, they would say, no the religion of jehovah’s witnesses is not a cult. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We do not do this because it is also part of the birthday celebration. 
											In the past few years, i’ve noticed that they also have graduation parties for the kids, but this was unheard. 
											Considering the above also explains a common question as to why jehovah&#039;s witnesses celebrate wedding anniversaries but not birthday anniversaries. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate most holidays or events that honour people who aren’t jesus. 
											That includes birthdays, mother’s day, valentine’s day and hallowe’en. 
											This is because jehovah&#039;s witnesses believe that celebrations are displeasing to god. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											A birthday is an anniversary of when you were born. 
											If you mean by singing, singing the birthday song. 
											Jehovah&#039;s witnesses do not believe in drinking and dancing. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate christmas because they do not believe that jesus was born on dec. 
											Jehovah also told the israelites to not take up the false religious customs of the surrounding nations. 
											They observe it on nisan 14 according to the ancient jewish lunisolar calendar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Although a birth is a gift from jehovah for us, and a very deep joy, we do not take part in birthday celebrations. 
											Jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate birthdays because we believe that such celebrations displease god. 
											Why do jehovah&amp;#39;s witnesses celebrate wedding anniversaries but not birthdays? 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Consider four of these aspects and related bible principles. 
											I have known some jw&amp;#39;s to celebrate big time for their 30th or 50th wedding anniversaries by throwing a big party with balloons, cakes, fancy dinners and gift giving but when it comes to celebrating birthdays they say they are not allowed? 
											Jehovah&#039;s witnesses commemorate christ&#039;s death as a ransom or propitiatory sacrifice by observing the lord&#039;s evening meal, or memorial. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jehovah&#039;s witnesses are taught that this is the only celebration the bible. 
											To be fair, orthodox christians do not celebrate birthdays either. 
											Although the bible does not explicitly forbid celebrating birthdays, it does help us to reason on key features of these events and understand god’s view of them. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											(ezekiel 18:4) therefore, jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate the holidays listed below, which promote belief in the immortality of the soul:all souls’ day (day of the dead).this is a day for “commemorating all the faithful departed,” according to the new catholic encyclopedia. 
											We do not celebrate birthdays because, although t. 
											Consider four of these aspects and related bible principles. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Why do jehovah’s witnesses forbid birthday celebrations? 
											As a matter of fact, that’s the number one problem. 
											They are allowed minimal contact with you like at school or work.
