					<p>Before god told moses that the month of the exodus ( nisan ) was to become the start of the religious year, tishri 1 was the start of all years, from creation to the exodus from egypt. But as many gather to exchange gifts, sing carols and marvel at nativity scenes and christmas trees, the story behind jesus. The birth of jesus christ is traditionally celebrated on december 25 th, although “around 37 percent of orthodox christians, mainly in egypt and russia, celebrate christmas on january 7,” owing to a difference in the way their calendars were devised.(egypt today.)neither date is likely correct in light of several clues uncovered by historians and information in the bible itself. <br>

											<strong>When is jesus real birthday date</strong>. 
					
											However, they claim that this day is as good as any other to celebrate the birth of jesus, despite the fact that it was originally a pagan celebration called saturnalia which commemorated the birth of the sun god. 
											History convincingly shows that december 25 was popularized as the date for christmas, not because christ was born on that day but because it was already popular in pagan religious celebrations as the birthday of the sun. 
											25 as the birth of jesus. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The urantia book says that jesus was born at noon, august 21, 7 b.c. 
											Since the early 20th century, many mormons have thought they knew the exact date of the first christmas. 
											Some scholars think that he was born between 6 b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											However, the date of jesus&#039; birth is not explicitly stated in the gospels. 
											However, the authors do not say if this is a julian calendar date or a proleptic gregorian calendar date. 
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.the date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The date of birth of jesus of nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 bc and 4 bc. 
											This date had already been reported by cnn and history channel for the last 4 years. 
											The bible does not specify a date or a month when jesus was born. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The earliest documented date of christmas being observed on december 25th was in 336, during the era of the roman emperor constantine (the first christian roman emperor). 
											Amazingly this corresponds to tishri 1 on the jewish calendar which is the first day of the festival of the feast of trumpets. 
											The feast of trumpets (rosh hashanah) is the start of the jewish civil year. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
											25 was popularized as the date for christmas, not because christ was born on that day, but because it was already popular in pagan religious celebrations as the birthday of the sun. 
											When jesus was born seems to have an obvious answer since our dating system is based on the idea that jesus was born between the eras we call b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the. 
											Despite not knowing the exact birthday of jesus, we celebrate his birth on december 25th as has been christian tradition for centuries. 
											History convincingly shows that dec. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The bible says that when jesus was born, a multitude of angels appeared suddenly and erupted in joyful praise to god, saying: 
											But nobody really knows exactly when jesus was born. 
											There are many different theories as to why christmas is celebrated on december 25. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											“glory in the heights above to god, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.” (luke 2:13, 14) however, it is noteworthy that nowhere in the bible is there even a suggestion that jesus’ birthday should be. 
											The date of birth of jesus is not stated in the gospels or in any historical reference, but most theologians assume a year of birth between 6 and 4 bc. 
											American king james version ×)) brings us to the end of september as the likely time of jesus&#039; birth.

											But is it possible that dec. 
											The date of jesus&#039; birth according to the word of god the bible actually does not give the date as directly as we might like. 
											Christians also celebrate the birth of jesus near the winter solstice, on christmas, or the epiphany (january 6). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born.the. 
											(a) by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the gospels of.

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Circa 200, clement of alexandria noted that christians in egypt believed jesus was born on may 20. 
											De paschæ computus, written in 243, notes the some groups of christians celebrated the feast of christ’s birth on march 28 and others on april 19/20. 
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											To find jesus’ birth date, most researchers. 
											Assuming jesus was an historical figure, the star. 
											The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating, but the year is estimated through three different approaches:

							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											M ost biblical scholars and preachers readily admit that they know christ was not born on december 25th. 
											This is an amazingly late date. 
											On september 11, 3 b.c., sunset was at 6:18pm and moonset at 7:39pm. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And 4 b.c., based partly on the biblical story of herod the great. 
											When is his real birthday? 
											Although it is difficult to determine the first time anyone celebrated december 25 as christmas day, historians are in general agreement that it was sometime during the fourth century. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											However, by piecing together a number of clues we can come close to establishing the correct date of jesus&#039; birth. 
											This was the very date on which jesus was born. 
											7 years ago (2001), the bbc and discovery channel reported that april 17, 6 bc was jesus&#039; actual birthday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And if it’s not in december, then why do we celebrate christmas in december? 
											The earliest attempts to date the birth of christ produced various results: 
											Two main methods have been used to estimate the year of the birth of jesus:
