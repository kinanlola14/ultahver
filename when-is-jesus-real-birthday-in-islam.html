		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>When is jesus real birthday in islam</strong>. 
					
											Atheists, sunni islam isnt that bad though? 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
											It happened on the day of the passover, which was held on the 14th of the jewish month nisan, in the spring. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											In your book you say that in islam the “comforter” of john 14:16—who christians understand to be the holy spirit—is interpreted to be muhammad. 
											The actual delivery of the messiah is unkown. 
											Two main approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of jesus: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
											Later, the gentiles would make up most of the christian world. 
											One based on the accounts in the gospels of his birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											30 ce, jerusalem), religious leader revered in christianity, one of the world’s major religions.he is regarded by most christians as the incarnation of god. 
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
											Christians also celebrate the birth of jesus near the winter solstice, on christmas, or the epiphany (january 6). 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The quran mentions the torah, the zabur (psalms) and the injil (gospel) as being revealed by god to the prophets moses, david and jesus respectively in the same way the quran was revealed to muhammad, the final prophet and messenger of god according to muslims.however, muslims generally view these books (i.e the bible, or parts of it) as having been corrupted, altered and interpolated over. 
											The case of jesus with god is like the case of adam. 
											History convincingly shows that december 25 was popularized as the date for christmas, not because christ was born on that day but because it was already popular in pagan religious celebrations as the birthday of the sun. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The similarities of jesus in islam and in christianity—for instance, jesus’ miracles and his birth to the virgin mary—may be of more importance than what divides christians and muslims. 
											عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ ‎, lit. 
											Mary is described as being a virgin, chosen by god, and considered with great honor. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											The date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
											The quranic titles of jesus 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But nobody really knows exactly when jesus was born. 
											(quran, 3:59) during his prophetic mission, jesus performed many miracles. 
											The words &#039; santa claus &#039;, appear nowhere in the bible. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Nope it became actual the birthday of the pagan solar god tammuz. 
											He created him from dust, and then he said to him, “be!” and he came into being. 
											Assuming jesus was an historical figure, the star. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born.the. 
											Many human beings trust christ&#039;s birthday became actual in the course of the. 
											The gentile wise men came to worship jesus. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											His name will be christ jesus, the son of mary. [qur&#039;an 3:45]. 
											If aliens descended on earth during the christmas season, they would undoubtedly believe christmas as being santa&#039;s birthday. 
											The history of christian reflection on the teachings and nature of jesus is examined in the article christology. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Constantine a roman emperor christenized that day alongside with easter etc. 
											Sometime after he had considered a creative and prescient of the flow and supposedly grew to develop right into a christian. 
											Jesus didn&#039;t celebrate his birthday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											As in the christian new testament, the quran (the central religious text of islam) describes jesus as the. 
											Jesus real birthday is not mentioned in the bible. 
											Christ jesus the son of mary was (no more than) an apostle of allah. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											&#039;jesus, son of mary&#039;), or jesus, is the penultimate prophet and messenger of god and the messiah, who was sent to guide the children of israel with a new revelation: 
											Muslims don’t believe jesus was the son of god, but they do revere him as a holy prophet. 
											Allah gives you glad tidings of a word from him: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											In islam, ʿīsā ibn maryam (arabic: 
											When jesus was born seems to have an obvious answer since our dating system is based on the idea that jesus was born between the eras we call b.c. 
											Jesus, also called jesus christ, jesus of galilee, or jesus of nazareth, (born c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The reasoning above does not give us an exact date and there are too many unknown variables to be able to do that from just that information. 
											Jesus, or isa, as he is known in arabic, is deemed by islam to be a muslim prophet rather than the son of god, or god incarnate. 
											“i have come to you with a sign from your lord. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The name jesus is mentioned at least 25 times in the quran, and many other references are made to the. 
											Humans picked a date to so call celebrate his birth. 
											He is referred to by name in as many as 25 different verses of the. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But to me the date is more commercial than anything holy. 
											Similarly, jesus showed us how god&#039;s favor rests with the poor and downtrodden. 
											He is the central figure of christianity, the world&#039;s largest religion.most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah (the christ) prophesied in the old testament. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											God tells us that jesus said: 
											Herod&#039;s attempt to kill jesus foreshadows jesus&#039; crucifixion about 33 years later. 
											Some scholars think that he was born between 6 b.c. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But islam and christianity share some very basic ideas about who jesus was and how he lived. 
											However, saint nicholas (santa claus) was a real person, a bishop, who was born 300 years after jesus. 
											Moreover, jesus specifically commanded his followers to commemorate that day in remembrance of him. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											And 4 b.c., based partly on the biblical story of herod the great. 
											And zakariya and john, and jesus and elias: 
											All in the ranks of the righteous: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											(luke 22:19) the bible contains no such command to celebrate jesus’ birthday, nor, for that matter, any other person’s birthday. 
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time.
