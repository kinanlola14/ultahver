		  	<h3 class="h6 p-2"><b>Although it’s not impossible, it seems unlikely that jesus was really born on december 25.</b></h3>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
											<strong>What day is really jesus birthday</strong>. 
					
											The holiday was celebrated as the roman pagan solstice, or birthday of the unconquered sun, which began on december 17 and ended december 25. 
											You can make it pagan by adding santa. 
											The biblical accounts point to the fall of the year as the most likely time of jesus&#039; birth. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Lacking any scriptural pointers to jesus&#039;s birthday, early christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar. 
											Speculation as to the time of jesus’ birth dates back to the 3rd century, when hyppolytus (ca. 
											I think its ok to celebrate jesus, an you can celebrate jesus everday. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree. 
											We hold this day holy, not like the pagans because of the birth of the sun, but because of him who made. 
											Jesus&#039; birth, death and resurrection. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The earliest mention of some sort of observance on that date is in the philoclian calendar, representing roman practice, of the year 336. 
											Another approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when jesus began preaching, using the statement in luke 3:23 that he was about 30 years of age at that time. 
											M ost biblical scholars and preachers readily admit that they know christ was not born on december 25th. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25. 
											Tradition has made december 25th the birthday of jesus. 
											Why the virgin mary assures us that december 25 is the birthday of christ. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But the bible clearly reveals he was not born on that day. 
											The church began celebrating this day as the feast of the annunciation—when gabriel announced that mary would be with child and she conceived. 
											The birth of jesus christ is the one of the most significant events in all of history and when we understand the truths regarding the true date of his birth it will thrill and inspire your heart. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											But is it possible that december 25 could be the day of christ&#039;s birth? 
											The first official mention of december 25 as a holiday honoring jesus’ birthday appears in an early roman calendar from 336 a.d. 
											Prior to this period, different christians celebrated christmas on different dates. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Although most christians celebrate december 25 as the birthday of jesus christ, few in the first two christian centuries claimed any knowledge of the exact day or year in which he was born.the. 
											He is the central figure of christianity, the world&#039;s largest religion.most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah (the christ) prophesied in the old testament. 
											When the julian calendar was established, julius caesar set march 25 as the date of the vernal equinox, which was also taken by many people as the beginning of a new year. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Just like the mystery of the eucharist, our god became small so that we could be holy and close to him. 
											The 15th day of the 7th month begins the feast of tabernacles (lev. 
											However, they claim that this day is as good as any other to celebrate the birth of jesus, despite the fact that it was originally a pagan celebration called saturnalia which commemorated the birth of the sun god. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Jesus was born on the. 
											Was jesus born on december 25? 
											Look for two more posts in the next several days: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											History shows that december 25 was popularized as the date for christmas, not because christ was born on that day, but because it was already popular in pagan religious celebrations as the birthday of the sun. 
											When jesus was really born can be assumed based on. 
											Here are three reasons why jesus may not have been born on december 25 at all. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Sitting a day aside to focus on jesus, an what he did for us isn’t bad. 
											But nobody really knows exactly. 
											Is december 25 jesus’ birthday? answer: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											The birth of jesus christ is traditionally celebrated on december 25 th, although “around 37 percent of orthodox christians, mainly in egypt and russia, celebrate christmas on january 7,” owing to a difference in the way their calendars were devised. 
											But could december 25 be the date of christ&#039;s birth? 
											The birth of christ would be about or on december 25. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											We can estimate when jesus was born by counting backward from his death on passover, nisan 14 in the spring of the year 33 c.e. 
											More to the point, if jesus&#039; birthday is celebrated on august 21 of the current calendar, is that really the anniversary of his birth? 
											So then, if john the baptist was conceived shortly after the jewish day of the atonement, then the traditional catholic dates are essentially correct. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Firstly, the actual birth day of jesus was not december 25.the date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
											The day celebrated as christmas (december 25) is the actual birthday of jesus. 
											On christmas day, we celebrate god taking flesh and living among us: 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Now when he was born the angels rejoiced. 
											This is what we call the incarnation. 
											Jesus began to preach after being baptised by john the baptist, and based on luke’s gospel john only began baptizing people in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Well it really is not his birthday, jesus was god in flesh. 
											The date we celebrate was adopted by the christian church as the birthday of christ in the fourth century. 
											In about 200 c.e., tertullian of carthage figured that day out to be march 25 on the roman calendar. 
									</p>
							<p class="p-2" align="justify">
					
											Different dates are proposed for jesus’ birth “since john was born on passover, the 15th day of nisan (the 1st jewish month), jesus would have been born six months later on the 15th day of tishri (the 7th jewish month).
